They wanted a clean, open design to engage many clients. We blended simplicity with quality, paying close attention to brand elements. \nWe showcased their 3D logo at the stand's centre for maximum visibility. The giraffe logo adorned the wall in vertical splendour with white LED strips. We maintained a consistent, clean look with white-toned furniture, bar counter, and flooring. The raised floor added workspace and concealed services. \nIn the end, we delivered a sleek, functional expo stand that met all of Bambora's exhibition needs.",
