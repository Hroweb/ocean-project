        overview: "Bambora, our long-time client in Online Payment Solutions, approached us in 2019 for a standout exhibition at SiGMA iGaming Summit. They wanted a clean, open design to engage many clients. We blended simplicity with quality, paying close attention to brand elements. \nWe showcased their 3D logo at the stand's centre for maximum visibility. The giraffe logo adorned the wall in vertical splendour with white LED strips. We maintained a consistent, clean look with white-toned furniture, bar counter, and flooring. The raised floor added workspace and concealed services. \nIn the end, we delivered a sleek, functional expo stand that met all of Bambora's exhibition needs.",

We presented two options—one within the client's budget and another slightly above. This allowed the client to envision the best outcome for their exhibition. \nThe stand had a modern and dynamic design with sleek furniture that complemented the overall atmosphere.
